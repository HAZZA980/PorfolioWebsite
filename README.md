Hello, I'm Harry. Welcome to my Portfolio Website!

I am currently undertaking an Erasmus year at Stockholm University to broaden my skills and to experience new cultures. 
I will be returning to De Montfort University in October 2024 to complete my final year of BSc Computer Science where I am currently on track for a First Class Degree.

This Webpage predominantly uses HTML, CSS with a little JavaScript. This was created purely to broaden my CSS skills.
This Webpage is the third version as further develops my understanding of Web development.
I have utilized semantic HTML and used a wider range of CSS properties to enhance this webpage.

I will soon add projects which are related to web-development. All back-end projects can be found in the corresponding github repositories.
